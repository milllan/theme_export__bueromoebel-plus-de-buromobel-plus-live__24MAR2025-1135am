Summary of Optimizations for bueromoebel-plus.de:


Here's a breakdown of the key changes made to the Shopify theme code to improve website speed and Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, TBT/FID):

1. Image Optimization:

Native Lazy Loading: Implemented native browser lazy loading (loading="lazy") for images that are likely off-screen when the page first loads (e.g., in product cards, testimonials, multi-column sections, footer, media grids, rich text images).

Benefit: Reduces initial page weight and speeds up the loading of critical above-the-fold content by deferring the loading of off-screen images until the user scrolls near them. Improves LCP and reduces network bandwidth usage.

Prioritized Critical Images (LCP):

Identified likely Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) candidates (e.g., the first slideshow image, collection banners, images in the first couple of sections) and ensured they load eagerly (loading="eager", fetchpriority="high").

Added preload hints for these critical images, telling the browser to download them sooner.

Benefit: Significantly improves the LCP metric by ensuring the main visual content loads quickly.

Efficient Slideshow Loading: Optimized the main homepage slideshow (slideshow.liquid) to load the first slide's image immediately (eager, high priority, preload) and lazy-load subsequent slide images.

Benefit: Crucial for homepage LCP, as the first slide is often the largest element initially visible.

Asynchronous Decoding: Added decoding="async" to many images.

Benefit: Allows the browser to decode images off the main thread, potentially reducing blocking time (TBT) and improving overall responsiveness.

Explicit Dimensions/Aspect Ratios: Ensured image tags have appropriate sizes attributes and sometimes width/height or rely on CSS aspect ratios.

Benefit: Helps the browser reserve space for images before they load, reducing Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

Removed JavaScript Lazy Loading (Lazysizes): Replaced the external lazysizes.min.js library with native browser lazy loading where applicable. For cases where lazyload class might still be used (potentially by apps), implemented a smart loader that only loads lazysizes.min.js if and when an image needing it is about to scroll into view.

Benefit: Reduces the initial JavaScript download size and execution time, improving TBT and overall load speed, by leveraging modern browser features.

2. JavaScript Optimization:

Deferred Non-Critical JavaScript: Ensured theme JavaScript (theme.min.js, vendor.min.js) uses defer so it doesn't block HTML parsing. Used techniques like requestIdleCallback or DOMContentLoaded with requestAnimationFrame for less critical tasks (like calculating header/announcement bar height).

Benefit: Improves First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI) by letting the page render sooner. Reduces Total Blocking Time (TBT).

Conditional Loading of App Scripts: Modified loading for "Bold Options" scripts to only load on relevant page types (product, collection, cart, search).

Benefit: Prevents unnecessary loading of heavy app scripts on pages where they aren't used (like the homepage), significantly speeding up those pages.

Delayed Third-Party Scripts:

Implemented Intersection Observer for the "ProvenExpert" widget script in the footer, delaying its loading and execution until the user scrolls close to it.

Added prefetch for the Klaviyo script, suggesting the browser download it during idle time.

Benefit: Reduces the impact of third-party scripts on initial load times and TBT. Third-party scripts are often a major source of performance bottlenecks.

Faster Navigation (Prerendering & Prefetching):

Implemented the Speculation Rules API (for compatible Chrome browsers) to prerender pages the user is likely to navigate to next (when hovering or scrolling near links).

Added Quicklink library (loading on user interaction) as a fallback/complement to prefetch linked pages in the viewport during browser idle time.

Benefit: Can make subsequent page navigations feel almost instantaneous, dramatically improving the user experience.

3. CSS Optimization:

Render Performance (content-visibility / contain): Added CSS rules (content-visibility: auto, contain: content, contain-intrinsic-size) to major sections below the fold (e.g., slideshows after the first slide, product carousels, FAQs, footer).

Benefit: Tells the browser it can skip rendering and layout work for content that is currently off-screen, speeding up the initial rendering process and potentially reducing TBT. contain-intrinsic-size helps prevent CLS when this content eventually loads.

Optimized Off-Screen/Hidden Elements: Used content-visibility: hidden for initially hidden elements like the mobile navigation drawer or mega menus.

Benefit: Prevents the browser from spending resources rendering elements that aren't visible on load.

Delayed CSS Loading: Delayed the loading of bold-options.css until the DOM is ready and the element is present.

Benefit: Prevents non-critical CSS from blocking the rendering of the main page content.

Font Loading: Added system font fallbacks (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, etc.) to the main text font stack.

Benefit: Improves perceived load speed and reduces layout shifts (CLS) by showing readable text immediately while the custom web font loads.

Potential LCP/CLS Fixes: Added specific CSS (opacity: 1!important) to elements like the collection banner heading, potentially overriding theme fade-in effects that can delay LCP or cause CLS.

4. Resource Loading Hints:

Preconnect: Added preconnect hints for Klaviyo's domain. Existing hints for Shopify CDN were maintained.

Benefit: Speeds up connections to essential third-party domains by performing DNS lookups and TLS handshakes early.

Preload/Prefetch: Used preload for critical LCP images/fonts and prefetch for likely future resources (Klaviyo JS, Quicklink).

Benefit: Gives the browser precise instructions on which resources are important to load sooner (preload) or opportunistically (prefetch).

5. Monitoring:

Added DebugBear RUM: Integrated Real User Monitoring script.

Benefit: Allows ongoing monitoring of actual user performance data (including Core Web Vitals) to track improvements and identify future issues. (This is for monitoring, not a direct optimization itself).


In Summary:

We've performed a deep optimization of the theme code, focusing on modern web performance techniques. Key areas included: optimizing how images load (prioritizing critical ones, lazy loading others), streamlining JavaScript execution (deferring non-essential code, conditionally loading apps, delaying third-parties), improving CSS rendering efficiency, and adding hints for the browser to load resources faster and even prepare for future navigation. These changes are designed to significantly improve loading speed, reduce layout shifts, and enhance the overall responsiveness of the site, directly impacting Core Web Vitals scores and providing a much better experience for your users.


Third-Party App Performance (Klaviyo):

Issue: The Klaviyo popup loads a large (~2MB) image, significantly slowing down initial page load and negatively impacting the LCP score.
Constraint: Direct optimization of app-injected code/assets via the theme is not possible.

Recommendations:
ACTION NEEDED: Replace the large image within the Klaviyo popup settings with a web-optimized version (<200KB .JPG).
ACTION NEEDED: Adjust Klaviyo popup display rules (e.g., time delay, scroll trigger, exit intent) instead of immediate load.
Review popup targeting rules.
Expected Outcome: Addressing this will likely yield substantial improvements in loading speed and FCP/LCP, complementing the theme optimizations.
